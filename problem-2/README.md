  <h3>Problem statement</h3>
</div>

*Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with and , the first terms will be:*

**1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …**

*By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.**.*

  <h3>Solution algorithm</h3>
</div>

* First, we must remember that according to the assignment and the very definition of Fibonacci numbers: “Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.”
* Secondly, an even number is divisible by 2 without a remainder.
* Well, and most importantly, there is no need to calculate each element of the series each time anew. Because as soon as the Fibonacci number following the first two is obtained, the values are updated: the first number takes the value of the second, the second - the third (the sum of the first two).
* This cycle continues over and over again until it eventually reaches the desired 4,000,000.
